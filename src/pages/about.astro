            <p>
              I'm Gabby, a self-taught designer and storyteller with a passion for creativity and a desire to make a real difference in people's lives.
              I'm all about connecting with people through shared problems, creating small changes that pack a big punch, and leaving a lasting impact. 
              I enjoy solving complex problems with empathy, creative gusto, and I'm always looking for new and innovative ways to bring that vision to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey has taken me from digital marketing to defense systems to Amazon Robotics, where I've crafted digital solutions at the intersection of technology, business, and human needs. 
              I've helped Boston startups define their visual identity from the ground up and collaborated with scientists on SBIR and DARPA contracts‚Äîtranslating complex technical concepts into real-world products that deliver measurable impact.
              
              These diverse experiences have shaped my approach to design and strengthened my ability to 
              collaborate effectively with stakeholders across disciplines.

            When I'm not designing, you can usually find me hitting the gym cooking up a storm, or making art. I'm a firm believer that creativity isn't just a job - it's a way of life - and I strive to bring that same sense of passion and enthusiasm to everything I do.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about combining traditional artistic techniques with digital design, and I strive to 
            incorporate these cross-disciplinary approaches into my UX practice whenever possible.
